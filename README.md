## <center>A neat little vehicle manager for all your automotive needs.</center>

**Task 1**

  I will be making a vehicle manager for my project

**Task 2**

  This vehicle manager will allow the user to view and enter vehicles
  into their garage, displaying info such as brand, name, year, price, type.
  Those who are interested in the car/bike scene will have the ability to model
  their garage into this program, or play around with it by adding their own vehicles. 
  I'm interested in this project because my brother has a Nissan 370z
  and I thought it would be pretty entertaining to make a program inspired from it.

**Task 3**
- As a user, I want to be able to view the brand, name, year, price of all the vehicles in my garage in a numbered list
- As a user, I want to be able to view the brand, name, year, price of all the cars in my garage
- As a user, I want to be able to view the brand, name, year, price of all the motorcycles in my garage.
- As a user, I want to be able to add multiple vehicles with custom brand, name, year, price and type to either my car/motorcycle garage.
- As a user, I want to be able to remove multiple vehicles from either my car/motorcycle garage.
- As a user, I want to be able to save my vehicle garage to file (if I so choose)
- As a user, I want to be able to be able to load vehicle garage from file (if I so choose)
